Summary
This proposal moves 220,000,000 ARB from the Gaming Catalyst Program (GCP) multisig to the Arbitrum DAO treasury. This will leave 3,650,000 ARB for the GCP to continue operations until needing to seek a transfer of more funds from governance. It is unconscionable to continue to allow a 3/5 multisig hold $120M in ARB when they have failed to meet their agreed on oversight obligations.
